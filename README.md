# Corrie

## Features

Corrie is a software program for providing building design advice based on building performance simulation. 
It requires only a few inputs and uses EnergyPlus and OpenStudio to produce a series of simulations 
that explore how the building design is impacted by a variety of energy efficiency measures such as:
 
 - shape of the building
 - number of stories
 - orientation
 - wall insulation 
 - roof insulation
 - amount of windows
 - lighting power 
 
Corrie creates a PowerPoint presentation based on the simulation results for the measures selected and options chosen.
Each type of measure is shown as a graph on a slide with energy usage for each of the options selected.
In addition, a slide with the end-use breakdown is included as well as slides on the assumptions used.
